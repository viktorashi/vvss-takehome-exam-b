I used the @Tag annotation to categorize the tests
i made some for the credit-card, some cash, paypal, firstOrder, Non-FirstOrder etc, and more coarse-grained ones like tagging tests that target a particular method (proccessPayment, deliveryFee) and based on some "dependency analsysis" as well

Considering I've only changed the things related to the "processPayment" method, ill just run the test suite:

mvn test -Dgroups="processPayment"

showing the following tests fail for version A of the code, and succeeed for version B

testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithCash
testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithCreditCard
testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithPayPal
testProcessPayment_NonFirstOrderWithCreditCard

so no need to re-run everything
