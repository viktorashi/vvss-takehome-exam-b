Done some black-box testing

The names of the tests are as follows and wether or not they fail or pass on the first version (A) of the code:

testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithCreditCard - fail
testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithPayPal - fail
testProcessPayment_FirstOrderWithCash - pass
testProcessPayment_NonFirstOrderWithCreditCard -pass
testProcessPayment_InvalidAmount - pass
testCalculateDeliveryFee_LowAmount - pass
testCalculateDeliveryFee_HighAmount - pass

and they pretty much do what's implied

the first two tests' failure message; they both say the actual final ammount is lower than the expected amount, so going to work on that
